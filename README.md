# Valkair
---
This repository is a collection of all worldbuilding and campaign content for my Viking inspired Homebrew world called Valkair.

It is designed to be worked with using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and for that reason includes the .obsidian file so that it can be imported and worked with remotely.

This repository is also processed and can be built into my [website](www.williamvk.com) to provide web-access to its content (not the secret stuff obviously!). However the code to do this is contained elsewhere...
