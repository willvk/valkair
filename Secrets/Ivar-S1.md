Ivar's wife [[Ygritte]] was originally stolen from [[Balder Snow]] and their only son, 13 year old [[Harald]] is actually Balder's son. Ivar is infertile and after being unable to father his own children he decided to simply steal Balder's and claim him as his own.  The corpse they staked to a pyre and sailed down the river to [[Yorvik]] was actually a farmhands stillborn. This quieted any rumours of Ivar's shame and removed any claim of Balder as the father.
