[[Heimdall]] arrives at the [[The Black Tide Tavern]] and meets them.

Heimdall is a loud charismatic and boisterous traveller which kicks them all out of their gloom.

He calls himself simply a wanderer unless pressed and then says his name is Heimdall and that something has drawn him to this place again. A feeling which he hasn't felt in a long time. So he has come to find out what it was. And to have a drink and meet some people at the same time.

Heimdall is here because he has felt Hannah re-enter the world now she is freed from her prison. This can coincide with [[The Chosen]] preparing a ritual to resummon [[Hannah]] to a corporeal form once again, so she can take her rightful place as their leader and direct contact with [[Osgilliath]].
